## Shuyan Chen - Homepage

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of by Prof. Lian-Kuan Chen. 

### Research Interests

Thanks to all the generous support from Prof. Chen, I am currently focusing on Photovoltaic-Based Visible Light Communication (PV-VLC) researches. Besides PV-VLC, I am also highly interested in designing real-time FPGA communication systems and analog circuits for signal linaerization.
